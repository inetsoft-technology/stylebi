/**
 * AnalyticAssistant provides all non-presentation logic to support the
 * analytic services. Unlike AnalyticEngine, the AnalyticAssistant is not
 * distributable, which means it would always run in the same processing
 * as the web service and handlers. This is not a real limitation since
 * the AnalyticAssistant is on top of the AnalyticEngine layer. In a cluster
 * environment, the majority of the processing would be done in distributed
 * AnalyticEngine instances, and the AnalyticAssistant would serve more
 * as a single front-end to the cluster
